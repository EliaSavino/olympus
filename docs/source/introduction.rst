Introduction
============


**Olympus**  is a toolkit that provides a consistent and easy-to-use framework to access a number of optimization
algorithms (:ref:`planners`) as well as benchmark surfaces. In addition to analytic benchmark functions (:ref:`surfaces`),
a collection of experimental emulators (:ref:`emulators`) are provided. These are based on models (:ref:`models`) trained on experimental
datasets (:ref:`datasets`) from across the natural sciences, including examples from physics, chemistry, and materials science.
